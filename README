A simple example of a blog using Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Sass and Express.  It is based off of the excellent tutorial at http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb.  The code has been modified to use npm (instead of kiwi), Mongoose and EJS, and runs on newer versions of node. 

To run this, install node.js and mongodb then run the following (may require sudo access):
npm install express
npm install express-messages
npm install ejs
npm install sass
npm install mongoose

Then cd into the directory and run:
node app.js

You should be able to access the blog at:
http://localhost:3000
